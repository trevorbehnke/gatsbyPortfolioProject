      <h4>If you're wondering who I am...</h4>
      <p>I’m Trevor, a self-taught Front-End Developer from California.</p>
      <p>
        While studying Business Management in college, I became a Google Cloud
        certified Architect & Engineer, but I only built small projects that
        helped me get used to the infrastructure on the back end. I wasn’t
        building any UX/UI and I felt stuck...
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2019 I decided it was time for a change so I started to learn
        JavaScript whenever I had free time. I quickly started to love it and
        I’ve been studying Front-End development ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last couple of years, I taken hundreds of hours of online
        courses like Full Stack Open from the University of Helsinki, The Modern
        React Bootcamp by Colt Steele, Modern JavaScript From The Beginning by
        Brad Traversy, Complete React Developer in 2021 by Zero To Mastery, ES6
        JavaScript The Complete Developer's Guide by Stephen Grider, read
        JavaScript: The Definitive Guide from cover to cover, and also watched
        countless youtube videos about Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch
        of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you
        can check them out in my portfolio. I even started a blog that focuses
        on the art and philosophy of coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider myself a ‘forever student,’ eager to both build on my
        academic foundations as well as stay in touch with the latest technology
        and strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always want to learn more, do more, and be more. I’m also a firm
        believer that we should never settle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m hard working, super curious, passionate, committed, and also a fast
        learner!
