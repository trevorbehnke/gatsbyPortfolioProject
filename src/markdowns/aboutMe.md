I’m <span>Fidalgo</span> , a 23 years old self-taught <span>Front-end</span> developer , from <span>Portugal</span> .

After my college degree in _"Communication & Multimedia"_, I got a job as a "developer", where I stayed for almost 2 years, but I only developed websites with Wordpress custom themes, and HTML & CSS… So I _wasn’t learning and improving_, I _felt stuck_.

In October 2018 I decided it was _time for a change_, so I started to wake up at 6am to _study javascript before going into work_. I quickly started to <span>love Javascript</span>, and in January 2019 I decided to _take the risk and quit my job_. I’ve been studying Front-end development full time ever since and I documented my whole journey on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/fidalgodev/).

During this time, I took online courses like [Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass/) [The Complete Javascript Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course), [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/), [Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript), [ES6](https://es6.io), [Modern React w/ Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/), [React: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux), [Gatsby Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM), read book series ["You don’t know JS"](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), and also watched countless youtube videos about Javascript.

Because we know the best way to learn is to practice, I also did a bunch of personal projects with the knowledge I gathered from the courses, you can check them on my <scroll-link to='portfolio'>portfolio</scroll-link>. I even started my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8pnh6gmhMP-hyQ6MJb414g "Fidalgo Youtube Channel"), where I already have some tutorials about React, Redux and Firebase.

I always want to _learn more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m also a firm believer that we should <span>never settle</span>.

I’m _hard working_, _super curious_, _passionate_, _committed_, and also a _fast learner_!
